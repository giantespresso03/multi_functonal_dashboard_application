# Multi Functional Dashboard Application

### Used Framework: QT
### Used Language: C++

### Project Description:
I made a simple full-screen multi-functional dashboard application for casual or office use. I was mostly inspired by Google Home Hub and Amazon Echo Show, and tried my best to give the user a simple, yet effective experience. 

Here are the different functionalities of my application and the description of it:
- **Digital clock:** Displays the current time (which updates every second) by using the function `currentTime()` from `QTime` class
- **World clock:** Shows the current time in a different zone 
- **Current weather information:** Displays the temperature, humidity, and a picture description of the current weather according to the the zip code that the user enters. It fetches the information from an api that's been created through this website: https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions 
- **Map with the current traffic information:** Displays the current traffic information according to the zip code that the user enters. 
- **Digital photo frame:** Displays 5 different pictures as a slideshow. The time frame for each slide show is 10 seconds.
